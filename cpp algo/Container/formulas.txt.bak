1) n*(n-1)/2 .Same as NCR forumula which is N! / (N-R)! * R! and This formula is mostly used to find total number of subarrays for a given array of size n (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + .... + (n-1)) and sum of n-1 nums.

Calculating the number of good pairs:
Determining this involves basic maths and finding the combinations possible with 2 numbers.

n
 C = (n−r)!/n! ----->>>>>> Total pairs = 4C2 + 2C2 + 
r


2) n(n+1)/2 is getting the sum of 1 to n numbers.


Counting proper squares formula in Gauss circle problem 
R = 3
i=1   n1 = Floor(Sqrt(9-1))~Floor(2.8)=2
i=2   n2 = Floor(Sqrt(9-4))~Floor(2.2)=2
i=3   n2 = Floor(Sqrt(9-9))=0
N=4*(n1+n2+n3)=16




Complexities:

O(1), O(n), O(n2), O(n3)
O(logn), nO(logn)
O(log(m+n))



########################################### signed int range #####################

=> for int range(+ve and -ve), you can write this range in between (—10^9 to +10^9),  -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 . This range is also known as the range of a 32-bit signed integer
=> The range of integers that can be represented in a 64-bit architecture is from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 213. This range is also known as the range of a 64-bit signed integer.
=> The maximum value of an unsigned 64-bit integer is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
=> for long long int range(+ve and -ve), the range is in between (—10^18 to +10^18).
